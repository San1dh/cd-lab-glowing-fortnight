S7 Compiler Design lab programs done on Replit few months back.

Also, Replit's history feature is very interesting. It has its problems like tracking every single character change but it is cool to watch the changes from the beginning till now as a real-time video.

Yacc -d flag is important I think for making the y.tab.h file. From official [IBM documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/pl/aix/7.2?topic=y-yacc-command) about Yacc & its flags. Otherwise it will create errors & the Yacc file will not run properly. Once it is created for the first time, then I don't think it is important to use -d again.
